# CS340
# Client/Server Development 
# learned how to apply database systems concepts and principles to develop client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases.
#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
#Writing a program is a responsibility itself. There are various codes and bugs when i first tried programming, but i really enjoyed CRUD python as it will help be in my software engineering course.
#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
#My technique to approach a problem is to read through the requirements again and again, after understanding what the user really asked, i start creating project ahead of time.
#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
#Computer Scientist do a lot of cool stuff. My work will help any company to better assist their clients and their needs.
